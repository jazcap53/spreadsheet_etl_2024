## Spreadsheet ETL

* #### Extracts sleep data from a .csv file
* #### transforms the data into a db-friendly format 
* #### loads it into a PostgreSQL database, and
* #### outputs a specialized visualization.

I'm currently refactoring read_fns.py to remove side effects, as per Robert
C. Martin's _Clean Code_, and to improve the test suite.
